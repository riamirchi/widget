This reusable widget helps the user keep a check on the amount of time spent on Facebook by counting up to 10 minutes and displaying a bright red, familiar ‘STOP’ sign when the 10-minute mark is reached.  The circular indicator of time spent on the site and the red stop sign are affordances that are simple for the user to draw meaning from. The color red was chosen since it is normally associated with warnings, and a clear message is given when 10 minutes are up, encouraging the user to stop wasting time. At the same time, the widget does not intrude on the user by freezing the screen or through animation, nor does it block any text since it appears in the left hand corner of the Facebook page which is usually empty.

The 10-minute limit was chosen based on a Keas study (http://keas.com/blog/case-for-facebook/?view=infographic#.VHyMwNynMbs) that claims that a 10-minute Facebook break makes employees 40% more productive. 

The widget is coded in HTML, CSS and Javascript making it reusable and pluggable into any browser. To activate it only when the user visits Facebook, an additional check would be added (not currently in the code) that would make it appear. Some additional features would allow the user to input a preferred time limit. Currently, the widget only counts to one cycle of 10 but it could easily restart counting after displaying the warning sign for a few minutes.

The concept of a countdown timer isn’t novel, but applying it to Facebook through the intuitive design of a stop sign can help police unconscious wastage of time with the help of a simple, intuitive reminder.

Note: As per Jeff’s suggestion, I did not go the extra stretch of actually turning this into a Chrome plugin. I also did comment my code extensively since the emphasis of this assignment is the UI.  For help with CSS, I referred to http://css-tricks.com/css-pie-timer/
